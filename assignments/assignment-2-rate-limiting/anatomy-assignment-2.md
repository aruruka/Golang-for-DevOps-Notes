## I am a newbie to Golang. Can you explain the pivotal code of the assignment-2 to me? A thinking of the way of explanation would be like: \ """ What is the detailed requirements? Split the requirements into small tasks. Teach me how to think about splitting big requirement to small tasks, specifically for this case. Since the requirements is "XXX", and in Golang, to achieve "XXX", typically we would think about using A, B and C. Why using approach-A instead of B, C? """

I'll provide a detailed explanation of the rate limiter implementation in Go, breaking down the requirements and design choices step by step. Here's the breakdown:

### 1. Requirements Breakdown (from requirements.md)
The assignment requires building a rate limiter that:
- Makes HTTP requests at a fixed rate (5 req/sec)
- Handles different response statuses:
  - 200 OK: Process response, stop if body contains "DONE!"
  - 429 Too Many Requests: Back off for 10 seconds
- Implements graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM
- Runs continuously until stopped

### 2. Approach to Splitting Requirements
When breaking down requirements, I consider:
1. **Core functionality** (rate limiting mechanism)
2. **Error handling** (429 responses)
3. **Termination conditions** (DONE! message, signals)
4. **Concurrency model** (how to manage parallel execution)
5. **Resource cleanup** (graceful shutdown)

### 3. Design Choices in Go
The solution uses these Go concurrency primitives:
1. **Goroutines** (`go rl.Start()`)
   - Why? To run the rate limiter in background while main thread handles signals
   - Alternative: Could use worker pools, but overkill for this simple case

2. **Channels** (`StopChannel chan struct{}`)
   - Why? Safe communication between goroutines
   - Alternative: Sync primitives (mutexes) would be more complex for signaling

3. **Tickers** (`time.NewTicker`)
   - Why? Precise interval control for rate limiting
   - Alternative: `time.Sleep` would drift over time

### 4. Key Code Components
Here's the pivotal code with explanations:

**ratelimiter.go**:
```go
// RateLimiter struct holds state
type RateLimiter struct {
    Client      *http.Client
    Rate        int
    StopChannel chan struct{} // Channel for stop signals
}

func (rl *RateLimiter) Start() {
    ticker := time.NewTicker(time.Second / time.Duration(rl.Rate))
    defer ticker.Stop()

    for {
        select {
        case <-ticker.C: // Triggered at rate interval
            rl.MakeRequest()
        case <-rl.StopChannel: // Graceful shutdown
            return
        }
    }
}

func (rl *RateLimiter) MakeRequest() {
    // HTTP request handling and response processing
    // Includes special handling for 200/"DONE!" and 429
}
```

**main.go**:
```go
func main() {
    rl := ratelimiter.NewRateLimiter(5)
    go rl.Start() // Run in background

    // Signal handling setup
    sigChan := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
    signal.Notify(sigChan, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)
    
    <-sigChan // Wait for signal
    fmt.Println("Shutting down...")
    rl.Stop() // Trigger graceful shutdown
}
```

### 5. Why This Approach?
1. **Concurrency Model**:
   - Go's goroutines are lightweight (perfect for I/O-bound tasks)
   - Channels provide safe synchronization without locks
   - The pattern matches Go's "share by communicating" philosophy

2. **Rate Limiting Implementation**:
   - `time.Ticker` guarantees precise intervals
   - Simple loop with select handles both ticking and shutdown

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Backoff on 429 is explicit in code
   - "DONE!" check stops the limiter immediately

4. **Graceful Shutdown**:
   - Dedicated stop channel ensures no dangling goroutines
   - Signal handling follows Go best practices
