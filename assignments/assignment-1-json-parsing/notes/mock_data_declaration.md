# Can you show me where is the mock data declaring/initialization for the assignment requirement? I mean, there is an example of the returned JSON data from the server in the requirement, and we are supposed have implemented the return data by mocking it in unit test, am I understanding correctly?
You're absolutely correct! Let me show you where the mock data is declared and initialized in the unit tests. The mock data should match the JSON structure from the requirements. Perfect! Yes, you're understanding correctly. Let me highlight where the mock data is declared and how it matches the requirements:

## Mock Data Declaration Location

The mock data is declared in assignment_test.go at **lines 22-37**:

```go
// Create test data that matches the expected API response
testData := AssignmentData{
    Page:  "assignment1",
    Words: []string{"one", "two", "three"},
    Percentages: map[string]float64{
        "one":   0.33,
        "three": 0,
        "two":   0.66,
    },
    Special: []*string{
        stringPointer("one"),
        stringPointer("two"),
        nil, // This represents the null value
    },
    ExtraSpecial: []interface{}{1, 2, "3"},
}
```

## How It Maps to the Requirements

This mock data **exactly matches** the JSON structure from the requirements:

### Requirements JSON:
```json
{
  "page": "assignment1",
  "words": ["one", "two", "three"],
  "percentages": {
    "one": 0.33,
    "three": 0,
    "two": 0.66
  },
  "special": ["one", "two", null],
  "extraSpecial": [1, 2, "3"]
}
```

### Mock Data Mapping:
- ✅ **Page**: `"assignment1"` → `Page: "assignment1"`
- ✅ **Words**: `["one", "two", "three"]` → `Words: []string{"one", "two", "three"}`
- ✅ **Percentages**: Maps with float64 values → `map[string]float64`
- ✅ **Special**: Array with null handling → `[]*string` with `nil` for null values
- ✅ **ExtraSpecial**: Mixed types → `[]interface{}{1, 2, "3"}`

## The Testing Flow

1. **Mock Data Creation** (lines 22-37): Creates the expected data structure
2. **JSON Marshaling** (lines 39-43): Converts Go struct to JSON bytes
3. **Mock HTTP Response** (lines 45-52): Wraps JSON in an HTTP response
4. **API Testing** (lines 55-57): Tests the actual parsing logic
5. **Validation** (lines 69-104): Verifies each field was parsed correctly

## Key Testing Features

- **Null Handling**: `nil` in the `Special` array tests null value parsing
- **Mixed Types**: `[]interface{}{1, 2, "3"}` tests integer, integer, and string parsing
- **Pointer Handling**: Uses `stringPointer()` helper to create `*string` for nullable strings
- **Error Cases**: Additional tests for HTTP errors and invalid JSON

You're absolutely right - this is a proper unit test implementation that mocks the server response and validates that our parsing logic correctly handles the exact JSON structure specified in the requirements!
